When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you wanted to share with other people, for backup purposes, or to easily have access to your repository from a variety of places.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If Git auto-updated, it would be easy for Git to accidentally overwrite changes you had made.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A branch is a commit that separates from the current series of commits, allowing the sets of commits to be updated independently from each other. You would use this whenever you wanted to take a project in two different directions that still had a common set of commit parents.
	
	A clone copies a repository. If the clone is taken from a remote repository, that remote is added to the local list of remotes. The intent is usually to work on the repository with the intent of pushing the repository back to the remote at some other points. This is used mostly for collaboration.
	
	A fork creates a copy of a repository within GitHub. The intent is usually to work on a completely separate project using the forked repository as a starting point.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
